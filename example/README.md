This is a simple android project that demonstrates how to use the `dependencies.sh` script.
On top of that I've also included a gradle task that will collect/generate the required dependencies file. (have a look at `./gradle/check_dependencies.gradle`)

## Usage

Just have a look at the `./scripts/dependabot.sh` script and and you will see how simple all of this integrates.
